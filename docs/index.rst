Pybotics
========

Overview
--------

`Pybotics` is an open-source Python toolbox for robot kinematics and calibration.
It was designed to provide a simple, clear, and concise interface to quickly simulate and evaluate common robot concepts, such as kinematics, dynamics, trajectory generations, and calibration.
The toolbox is specifically designed for use with the `Modified Denavitâ€“Hartenberg parameters convention <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denavit%E2%80%93Hartenberg_parameters#Modified_DH_parameters>`_.

Please see the `README <https://github.com/nnadeau/pybotics>`_ for more information and examples.
